<h2 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="Project_Overview">1.1 Project Overview</h3>
<p>
Bookshelf is a web-based application that allows users to track and store the status of their collection of media content.
</p>
<h3 id="Purpose">1.2 Purpose</h3>
<p>
This document outlines the proposed bookshelf web-based application. It will outline the goals of the project and describe the main features. 
</p>
<h3 id="Audience">1.3 Audience</h3>
<p>
Bookshelf is for individuals who desire an efficient way to track the neverending backlog of entertainment content. Users will be able to receive recommendations on books or television shows they are interested in. They will also be able to see the media content that their friends are interested in. This platform allows the user to explore new sections or topics of interest that they might not know anything about as well as stay updated with media they are involved in already.
</p>
<h3 id="Scope">1.4 Scope</h3>
<p>
The scope of this project will be two-fold: act as a content-management system, and a recommendation system. The priority objective is to offer a seamless way to organize a collection of media, followed closely with the objective of discovering new and curated content for the user.
</p>
<h2 id="Document_Lexicon">2. Document Lexicon</h2>
<h3 id="Definitions">2.1 Definitions</h3>
<p>
<u>Friends</u>: Friends can be made by an individual by adding other users they know on bookshelf. They can also be able to see what their friends are currently interested in.
</p>
<p>
<u>My Bookshelf</u>: My Bookshelf contains the collection of media that is curated by the user. My bookshelf can track the status of ongoing media as well as suggest media based on the individual’s interests and likes.
</p>
<p>
<u>Registered User</u>: A user who has created an account and has logged in.
</p>
<p>
<u>User</u>: An individual who accesses the website.
</p>
<p>
<u>User Profile</u>: An individual’s directory of stored personal user settings and information related to the user. The personal profile provides functionality such as a list of tracking and storing media collections.
</p>
<h3 id="Acronyms_and_Abbreviations">2.2 Acronyms and Abbreviations</h3>
<p>
<u>API</u>: Application Program Interface. External software packages used in building this application.
</p>
<p>
<u>GUI</u>: Graphical User Interface. This is the interactive visual component for the software in which the user interacts. Ultimately consists of actions such as traditional buttons and information.
</p>
<p>
<u>SRS</u>: Software Requirements Specifications. This is the document which contains all requirements and the standard project management plan.
</p>
<h2 id="Overall_Description">3. Overall Description</h2>
<h3 id="User_Characteristics">3.1 User Characteristics</h3>
<p>
Bookshelf will focus on targeting mobile device users. Using modern web technologies with a mobile-first design will allow for cross-platform support and faster development while retaining user trust and expectations for native application patterns.
</p>
<h3 id="Assumptions">3.2 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
<p>
Bookshelf requires the user to have an internet connection as well as have a compatible device that is web-accessible.
</p>
<h3 id="Constraints">3.3 Constraints</h3>
<p>
There is no cost constraint for bookshelf as we will be using free software to implement the web-based application. However, the project does have a time constraint. The bookshelf application must be finished by the end of the current semester on April 12, 2021.
</p>
